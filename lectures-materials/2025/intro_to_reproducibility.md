description: A quick intro to reproducibility issues in the life sciences
---

**Instructor:** [Jean-Baptiste Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd)

## Outline

With this lecture, you will get a general introduction to reproducible - or irreproducible - life sciences.

Specifically, you will:

-   learn what is meant by reproducibility of research results in the life sciences
-   understand the main causes for irreproducible results
-   learn the possible collective and individual actions for curbing irreproducibility

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

-   Is the term "replicability" generally applied to obtaining the same results with another (new) dataset ?
-   Is the root cause of irreproducibility the publication incentive ?
-   What is a similar result with the same methodology or pipeline but different data ?
