title: Introduction to Machine Learning part 1
description: 🤖 Supervised Learning 📖
---

**Instructor:** [Nikhil Bhagwat](https://nikhil153.github.io/) & [Mohammad Torabi](https://github.com/mtorabi59)

## Outline

-   Define machine-learning nomenclature
-   Describe basics of the “learning” process
-   Explain model design choices and performance trade-offs
-   Introduce model selection and validation frameworks
-   Explain model performance metrics

## Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module

-   When is ML a useful approach?

-   Supervised learning

    -   Model training - what is under/over-fitting?
    -   Model selection - what is (nested) cross-validation?
    -   Model evaluation - what are type-1 and type-2 errors?

-   What NOT to do when using ML models in your research

## Things you will NOT learn in this module (if you are an advanced ML student)

-   In-depth review of unsupervised learning approaches (e.g. clustering)
-   How train deep-learning models
-   How to use and/or defeat chatGPT

**_IMPORTANT!_**
To fully understand the material taught in this module,
you should make sure that you are already familiar with the following concepts
(please take some time to review them if needed):

-   Basics of linear algebra (check out [these videos](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs) if you need a refresher)
    -   Do you know how to use vectors?
    -   Do you know how to multiply two matrices?

-   Basics of linear regression
    -   Do you know what a mean-square error is?
    -   How to fit linear regression or GLMs?
