  sciences
- understand the main causes for irreproducible results

To follow most of the other modules, you will have to have some basic
understanding of the command line. In this module we'll take a look at the the
BourneAgainSHell (BASH), the default command line in most Linux systems. You
will learn how to:

- move around on your computer with the command line, create and open
  directories and files
- find things with the command line (files and programs, PATH variables)
- run useful command line programs and find help (`find`, `grep`, `ls`, and
  `man` / documentation)

(4) Without running the code on your machine, which string is returned by
my_function when called with the specified parameters?

```python
def my_function(x, y, z):
    result = ""
    if len(z) <= 6 and len(z) > 2:
        result = z[-2] + y
    else:

    operating system
  - Docker is a good choice for shared systems because of its high level of
    security
